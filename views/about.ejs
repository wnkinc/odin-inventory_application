        <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
        <p>
          Each year, many children go without presents during the holiday
          season. By using this application, donors and organizers can work
          together to spread joy and ensure that no child is left out. With
          efficient inventory management, we can maximize the impact of every
          donation and create a brighter holiday for everyone.
